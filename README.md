# Credit Score Management System
Another project I created as a my personal Bank's credit score and client management system. In this project I utilized different.
It provides a set of RESTful APIs for managing credit score data, allowing for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities representing clients and their credit scores. The application manages clients' details such as name, phone number, age, credit score, and current credits. It also integrates Swagger for API documentation.

Features
Create: Add new client credit score records.
Read: Fetch a list of all clients or specific client details by ID.
Update: Modify existing client credit score details.
Delete: Remove a client record from the database.
Swagger: Integrated API documentation for easy API exploration and testing.
Technologies Used
Java 17: Programming language.
Spring Boot: Framework for building the backend services.
Spring Data JPA: For database interactions.
PostgreSQL: In-memory database for testing, or PostgreSQL for production.
Swagger: For API documentation and testing.
Maven: For build and dependency management.
